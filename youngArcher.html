			The Young Archer was born with a congenital growth-hormone condition that gave him the outward appearance and voice of an adolescent boy, hence the name The Young Archer. He was actually not fond of that name at all as he was often the eldest person in the room, but was treated as if he was still a child.
			Sucks doesn't it?

  			x="Through his boyhood he suffered through years of constantly being teased and berated for his appearance by siblings Michael and Angelo and he never had anybody to turn to in his life. The Young Archer would often play alone in his kitchen, rolling around on the countertops. There was something about the fact that they were made of marble that he really enjoyed, some would say a bit too much. Its okay though, he eventually found his way want to know what happened next? He was a natural in his position and everything was going really well until he was sent on a high profile mission, infiltrating a certain notorious musicians home on a case. While there it began to rain and he refused to play in the rain, because he was not fond of the idea of water dripping on his head. This arouse suspicion because everyone knows that kids love to play in the rain and he had abort mission. The word spread that there was a spy doubling as a child and The Young Archer had to undergo a complete image change comprised of hours of grueling plastic surgery which resulted in him no longer looking like a young boy, but rather now looking like an adult male. With this change in image, came a change in name, and Young was dropped from his name. However, the mission was not at a complete loss, because while on the case he managed to become quite good friends with another spy who was doubling as a musician, Justin Timberlake, who advised him that while he was changing his name he should 'Drop the 'The.'' Just ''Archer.'' It is cleaner'.<br><br>And with that suggestion, Archer, the spy was born and The Young Archer was forgotten.";
